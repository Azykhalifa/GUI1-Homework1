To be a successful Full-Stack Web Developer, you need to be familiar with both front-end and back-end development. In order to land a job as a Full-Stack Web Developer, it is important to have a good understanding of basic building blocks such as HTML for text and CSS for design. With javascript becoming more and more popular, having a solid grasp on the language itself as well as key elements such as DOM, JSON, callbacks can help make learning a framework easier. Unlike front-end, back-end deals with understanding how database operations, user authentication, and application logic work. It essentially does not matter which back-end language you choose to learn, as long as you comprehend what is going on. Also, being able to choose between relational data and NoSQL databases for specific tasks can help with storing web applications. In order for the consumer to connect with the server, HTTP protocol is ultized and REpresentational State Transfer or REST has made it easier for this communication to take place. To be more skilled at web architecture, it is important to work on projects and examine codebases to have a better idea on how to structure the code. When working on a team with other developers, GIT, a version control system, can update each member of any changes or fixes to the codebase. Finally, honing your data structure skills can help prevent inefficient coding and allow better use of tools at hand to accomplish the tasks in the best logical way.
