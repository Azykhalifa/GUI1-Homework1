        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> I am a senior at University of Massachussets lowell majoring in Computer
        Science. Some of the skills and qualities I have developed over the years
        as a student and working in retail include ......The reason why I chose
        to study Computer Science is because I am really passionated about
        learning new technologies and staying up to date with
        news about them. After taking few courses in my degree pathway, I have
        realised that front end developing is something that I really like doing
        as well. </p>
