        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p class = "border pictureshadow"> I am a senior at the University of Massachussets Lowell majoring in Computer
        Science. Some of the skills and qualities I have developed over the years
        as a student and working in retail include professional communication,
        time management and customer satisfaction.<br>
        The reason why I chose to study Computer Science is because I am really
        passionate about learning new technology and staying up to date with
        news about them. After taking few courses in my degree pathway, I have
        realised that front end developing is something that I really like doing
        as well. </p>

        <h2> Hobbies</h2>
        <p class = "border pictureshadow"> During my free time, I like to keep myself busy with things that I
        love to do outside of school. Some of them being photography, video editing,
        sports and video games. Usually, I would prefer playing cricket if I have
        enough people available to play. <br>
        Some of my favorite video games include Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V,
        and Fortnite Battle Royal.
